                    <p class="answer">I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly,
                        but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are,
                        but that's not for
                        me to decide. So,
                        what is it? Cake or pie?</p>

                    <h3 class="question">MaryLou wore the tiara with pride</h3>
                    <p class="answer">There was something that made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit
                        easier when she wore it. She really didn't care what those staring through the window were
                        thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="answer">which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave
                        National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at
                        Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave
                        before we head back.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">It was a scrape that he hardly noticed</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Sure,
                        there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he
                        acquired on his adventures. There was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut
                        had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream. He felt perfectly
                        normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">I recollect that my first exploit?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">I had wandered into it at noontime,
                        when all nature is peculiarly quiet,
                        and was startled by the roar of my own gun,
                        as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.
